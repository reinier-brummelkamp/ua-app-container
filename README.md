# ua-app-container

App container component for the Solitude framework.


## Styling
`app-container.css` contains sample styles that define a basic `flex-box` layout for the `app-container` element.
Use `app-container.css` as a starting point to define or customize the styling for your app-container requirements.

## TODO!!!
AppCenterFrame now expects a neon-animated-pages.app-container-app-center-frame element, abstract this to allow animations to be configurable
